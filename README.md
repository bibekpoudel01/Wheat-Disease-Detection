## Wheat Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
# 1. Introduction
This project explores the use of advanced neural network models such as VGG19, Xception, and InceptionV3 to detect diseases in wheat plants. By leveraging pre-trained ImageNet weights, we accelerate training and improve model performance for this computer vision task.

The workflow involves:
1.Importing and loading essential libraries for image processing and model training.

2.Preprocessing images and making them compatible with Keras.

3.Training neural networks to classify wheat images as healthy or diseased.

This approach provides an efficient pipeline for detecting wheat plant diseases using deep learning.
